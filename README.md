# Bank Loan Report - README

## Problem Statement
Banks need to efficiently analyze loan application data to assess lending performance, monitor loan repayment trends, and manage credit risk. A comprehensive reporting system is required to track key financial metrics, identify potential risks, and optimize decision-making in loan approvals and collections. This report provides a data-driven approach to understanding loan trends, borrower behavior, and financial performance, enabling the bank to enhance operational efficiency and reduce default risks.
